PopIt
=====

PopIt is an easy-to-install web service for storing and sharing the
names and career histories of public figures like politicians and
celebrities. We built it to save time and ssave pain for anyone
building a website that is built on top of a list of people, whether a
politician-watching site or a celeb-spotting one.

Key features:

* Lightweight, quick and easy to understand
* Data structure built on learning from our mistakes - so you don't have to
* Supports websites written in any language - uses REST
* Interfaces for adding data by hand, or via import
* Can be used either as a web service, or as a Django app.
