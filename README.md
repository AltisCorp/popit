# PopIt

The software that powers http://popit.mysociety.org/

## Warning

Here be dragons! This is **alpha** software - it is currently undergoing active development so should be used with caution.

## Installing

Please see  [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/mysociety/popit/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for full instructions.

## About

PopIt is an easy-to-install web service for storing and sharing the names and career histories of public figures like politicians and celebrities. We built it to save time and save pain for anyone building a website that is built on top of a list of people, whether a politician-watching site or a celeb-spotting one.

## Key features

* Lightweight, quick and easy to understand
* Data structure built on learning from our mistakes - so you don't have to
* Supports websites written in any language - uses REST
* Interfaces for adding data by hand, or via import

## Original Django based code

Originally the PopIt project was started in Django, but has now changed to a different technology stack. The old code is still available on a [branch](https://github.com/mysociety/popit/tree/popit-v0.1dev).
