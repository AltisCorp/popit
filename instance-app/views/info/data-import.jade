  h1 Data Import

  p
    | PopIt will let you enter and access data easily from your code. It will 
    | also let you upload existing data that you have to quickly populate a new 
    | site.
  

  h2 Migration Tool
  
  p 
    | If you have been collecting information on people in a spreadsheet this 
    | web based tool will let you quickly upload it all into PopIt rather than 
    | manually entering it in.

  p
    | Go to the 
    a(href="/migration", id="migration_tool") migration tool
    |  (which is currently a work in progress).
  

  h2 API

  p 
    | The API will let you access and modify all the data in PopIt, as well as 
    | storing your own custom data. Please see the API docs on an existing PopIt 
    | site for more details.
  
  p 
    | We use the API from the editing interface on the website to be sure that 
    | all interactions with PopIt can be achieved through the API. It is not an 
    | afterthought - it is a core piece of the site.
  
  p API improvements is an ongoing task with several 
    a(href="https://github.com/mysociety/popit/issues?labels=API&milestone=&page=1&state=open") open issues
    | . If you have particular suggestions or questions please let us know on the 
    a(href="https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/mailman/listinfo/components") components mailing list
    | .
