  p 
    | If you have been collecting information on people in a spreadsheet this 
    | will let you quickly upload it all into PopIt rather than manually 
    | entering it in. We expect that this will be in the form of a CSV file with 
    | the columns given specific names.

  p The migration tool is intended to add data to PopIt, not to edit it.

  if migration.length
    ul
      for single in migration
        li
          a(href="/migration/#{ single.id }") #{ single.source.name } 
            small (#{ single.created })

  form(method="post", action="/migration/upload", enctype="multipart/form-data")
    #migration_source_file
      label Source file
      input(type="file", name="source", value="")
      //if errors.source
        //span.error #{errors.source.type}

    input(type="submit", class="btn", value="Upload")
